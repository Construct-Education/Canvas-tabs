                <p>Sarah Kurtz McKinnon, the Instructional Support Specialist for this course, graduated cum laude from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University in 2008. Although she had a passion for writing, she had another passion as well: changing lives through the power of summer camp. In 2009, Sarah earned the opportunity to become one of the youngest YMCA camp executives in the country, taking the helm of Ann Arbor YMCA Camp Al-Gon-Quian at the age of 23. She served as the director of Camp AGQ for nearly six years. During that time, the camp saw incredible growth, with a 40 percent increase in positive annual net for the program and nearly $1 million in capital construction improvements. Sarah&rsquo;s dynamic and creative leadership approach took an already great camp to another level of excellence, receiving recognition at the national level for its success.</p>

        <p><br />Sarah handed off Camp Al-Gon-Quian to her successor in 2015 to become a camp consultant and trainer. Her goal was to help other camps and camp professionals reach their full potential. She also co-founded, with Jack Schott, The Summer Camp Society, a collaborative, community-based education program for emerging camp professionals. Sarah is regularly recruited to keynote camp and recreation conferences across the United States and actively writes about leadership in the camp and business settings. She co-authored a book for camp professionals with Steve Maguire, entitled <em>Not the Way You Have Always Done It</em>, and a case study she co-authored with Dr. Wayne Baker about organizational development was recently published by the <em>Harvard Business Review</em> and won the #1 case of the year by the Aspen Institute Business &amp; Society Program.</p>
        <p>In 2018, Sarah earned her Master&rsquo;s in Business Administration from the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, graduating with high honors. At Ross, she was a fellow in the +LAB at the Center for Positive Organizations and a student ambassador for the Office of Admissions. She lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with her husband and their two-year-old daughter.</p>
